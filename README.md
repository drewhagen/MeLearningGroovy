# MeLearningGroovy
Just playing around with Groovy

This repository demonstrates my initiative to learning Groovy through Pluralsight course "Groovy Fundamentals",
and has the materials I've coded along with.
All credit goes to author Jeremy Jarrel and Pluralsight.

For $30 a month (only 3x Netflix), Pluralsight is a very solid resource for a developer.
If you sign onto Microsoft's portal for VSCode:

... You can get 3 months of Pluralsight free!!
